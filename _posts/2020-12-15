  It is the 8th millennium and human civilization operates at a galactic level. 
Scattered across the cosmos are planets populated by different human species 
that arrived there thousands of years ago. According to the khardishev scale, 
this galactic civilization would rank on Type III. What does this have to do 
with the title of this article? You might be asking.

  Most people don't really think about the future all that much because obviously 
why should we? We have our 9 to 5´s, startups, and children to take care of in 
the present. Once in a while, however, it's really fun to think about humanities 
journey throughout the future and raise thought-provoking questions about the 
experiences our great great great great great grandchildren might experience. 
Cause why not?

  Sitting on a car ride to visit NASA JPL one burning hot summer afternoon, I was 
thinking profoundly of a possible future that I never thought of before until that 
very moment. Finally, all those sci-fi books came to good use. A possible future that 
was floating into my mind was a situation where humanity had reached a type III civilization.

**Type III civilization would own all the energy in their home galaxy and would be multiplanetary.**

In this hypothetical type III civilization *also assuming this is after thousands of generations and your long gone. 
If humans stayed on their respected planets for a long time then would humans experience planetary isolation? Could 
this result in the extinction of the Human Race? Planetary Isolation is just a scaled-up idea of geographic isolation. 
According to Darwin's theory of evolution, speciation or the creation of a new species can occur in multiple ways but 
geographic isolation is the one we are looking for now.
