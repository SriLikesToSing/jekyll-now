title: Guarni Verbs - 2009 North American Computational Linguistics Olmypiad 
---

This was a pretty interesting problem from the 2009 north american computational linguistics 
olympiad and I have to say, I was quite surprised this was labeled as a "hard" problem. Not 
what I expected from a hard problem as I thought this was somwhere along the lines of easy and 
medium. I probably thought so because I solved the problem with relativly low effort. Oh well, 
the linguistic gods let me have this one lmao.

Problem Statement:

The following Guaraní verb forms are listed along with their English translations.

japyhyta  : We will be catching
nohyvykõiri : He is not enjoying
ombokapu : He is shooting
pemomaitei :  You are greeting
ndokarumo'ãi : He will not be eating
ndapevo'oima : You were not taking
napekororõmo'ãi : You will not be crying
noñe'e͂ i : He is not talking
okororõ : He is crying
ndajajupirima : We were not waking up
ahyvykõima : I was enjoying
añe'e͂ ta : I will be talking
namomaiteiri : I am not greeting
japurahei : We are singing

*notes:
kororo = crying
maitei = greeting

karu = eating

mo ai = wll not
ma = were not, was
ta = will be



The answers that I got:


akaruma = I was eating
ojupita = He will be waking up
ndavo'omo'ai =  He will not be taking
napekororoi = You are not crying
ndapyhyima = I wasn't catching

You are not shooting = nepembokapui
He is not singing = ndo-puraheiri
We will be eating = jakaruta
I will not be singing = ndapuraheimo'ai
